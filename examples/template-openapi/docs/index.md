# OpenAPI Template

Welcome to the OpenAPI Template documentation. This template streamlines the process of creating API services with Kong Gateway integration.

## Overview

The OpenAPI Template automates the entire lifecycle of API deployment, from specification to gateway configuration. It's designed to help teams quickly scaffold API projects with production-ready Kong Gateway configurations.

## What This Template Does

- **Scaffolds Projects**: Creates a new project structure from your OpenAPI specification
- **Generates Kong Configuration**: Automatically creates Kong service and route configurations
- **Configures Kong Gateway**: Applies the configuration to your Kong Gateway instance
- **Creates Repository**: Initializes a new repository with your API specification

## Getting Started

To use this template:

1. Navigate to the **Create** page in your DevPortal
2. Select the **OpenAPI Template**
3. Provide your OpenAPI specification (URL or file)
4. Configure your Kong Gateway settings
5. Set repository details

The template will handle the rest, creating a complete API project with Kong Gateway integration.
