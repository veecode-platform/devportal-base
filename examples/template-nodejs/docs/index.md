# Example Template

This is a simple Backstage template that demonstrates how scaffolding works in the VeeCode DevPortal.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Template Does

This template creates a basic Node.js service when you run it through the Backstage scaffolder. It's intentionally simple to show the concept without overwhelming complexity.

## ðŸ“‹ What You Get

When you execute this template, you'll get:

- A basic `package.json` for a Node.js project
- A simple `index.js` file with an Express server
- A `catalog-info.yaml` file to register your service in Backstage
- A basic project structure

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Go to **Create** in the Backstage sidebar
2. Select **"Example Node.js Template"**
3. Fill in the required fields (name and repository)
4. Click **"Create"**
5. Your new project will be generated and registered in the catalog!

    This is just an example! Real templates can include much more complex project structures, CI/CD pipelines, documentation, and more.
