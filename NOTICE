Additional Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have made an effort to preserve the Copyright notices and attribution
information from the original RHDH project. Files directly copied should 
preserve them, but a considerate amount of files were also created and 
modified by LLMs (mostly GPT and Claude). Please notify us if anything was
missed and we will add the necessary attribution information.

Please consider good faith in this effort to create a lightweight and 
self-sufficient Backstage distro (VeeCode DevPortal) image.
